- Hi my name is Kirill
- I am a beginner programmer as of 10/27/2021 and I am very interested in web and app development
- I am currently learning Python and hope to get pretty good with it so that I can move on to other languages
- My goal is to become great in this field and maybe even move onto game development one day
- I'd like to look back onto this mini biography in a couple of years and smile at the progress I have made since then
